03 Diagnosis and Comorbidity Identification: R files and Mapping files

R files allow to use NCHDA record-level diagnosis and comorbidity codes to derive:

* diagnosis groups (R file 03.01), 
* comorbidity groups (R file 03.02)
* a results file with these outputs combined (R file 03.03).

The folder [mapping files](<mapping files>) contains the paediatric and adult mappings used to assign diagnosis and comorbidity groups.
