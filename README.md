# R code for analysing national data from England on Congenital Heart Disease 

**Ferran Espuny Pujol, Qi Huang, John Stickley, Rodney CG Franklin, Katherine Brown, Jiaqiu Wang, Sonya Crowe, Christina Pagel**

## Description

R code used for research on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) by the UCL Clinical Operational Research Unit (CORU) in the projects: 

* LAUNCHES QI - Linking audit and national datasets in congenital heart services for quality improvement;
* CHAMPION - Congenital heart audit: measuring progress in outcomes nationally (CHAMPION).

Note that although most of the code used in the research projects was in Stata, we have converted it to R for sharing.

## Code organization

* [Data Cleaning](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/01 Data cleaning>)
* [Patient Trajectories](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/02 Patient trajectories>)
* [Diagnosis and Comorbidity Identification](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/03 Diagnosis and comorbidity identification>)
* [Outcomes of Interest](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/04 Outcomes of interest>)
* [Risk Models](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/05 Risk models>)
* [Pathways of care for specific diagnoses](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/06 Pathways of care for specific diagnoses>)

Additional R code can be found in the [UCL CORU site](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/) for:

We are grateful to Libby Rogers, a previous UCL CORU researcher, whose Stata code served as starting point for working with NCHDA data.

We are grateful to the [LAUNCHES QI and CHAMPION project teams and collaborators](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-operational-research-unit/research-domains/congenital-heart-disease-children-and-adults). 

The LAUNCHES QI project and this CHD research R code were funded by the Health Foundation, an independent charity committed to bringing about better health and health care for people in the United Kingdom (Award number 685009).

The CHAMPION project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Department of Health and Social Care Policy Research Programme (grant number PR‐R20‐0318‐23 001).
