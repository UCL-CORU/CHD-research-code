## Description

R code used for research on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in the research projects: 

* LAUNCHES QI - Linking audit and national datasets in congenital heart services for quality improvement;
* CHAMPION - Congenital heart audit: measuring progress in outcomes nationally (CHAMPION).

## Code organization

* [Data Cleaning](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/01 Data cleaning>)
* [Patient Trajectories](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/02 Patient trajectories>)
* [Diagnosis and Comorbidity Identification](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/03 Diagnosis and comorbidity identification>)
* [Outcomes of Interest](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/04 Outcomes of interest>)
* [Risk Models](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/05 Risk models>)

Additional R code can be found in the [UCL CORU site](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/) for:
* [Linkage of records using patient identifiers](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/LAUNCHESQI_Linkage)
* [Identification of pathways of care for CHD sentinel diagnosis groups](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHAMPION-work-stream-2)

We are grateful to Libby Rogers, previous UCL CORU member, whose Stata code served as starting point for working with NCHDA data.

We are grateful to the [LAUNCHES QI and CHAMPION project teams and collaborators](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-operational-research-unit/research-domains/congenital-heart-disease-children-and-adults). 

The LAUNCHES QI project and this CHD research R code were funded by the Health Foundation, an independent charity committed to bringing about better health and health care for people in the United Kingdom (Award number 685009).

The CHAMPION project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Department of Health and Social Care Policy Research Programme (grant number PR‐R20‐0318‐23 001).
