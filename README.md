## Description

R code used for research on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in the research projects: 

* LAUNCHES QI - Linking audit and national datasets in congenital heart services for quality improvement;
* CHAMPION - Congenital heart audit: measuring progress in outcomes nationally (CHAMPION).

## Code organization

* [Data Cleaning](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/01 Data cleaning>)
* [Patient Trajectories](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/02 Patient trajectories>)
* [Diagnosis and Comorbidity Identification](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/03 Diagnosis and comorbidity identification>)
* [Outcomes of Interest](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/04 Outcomes of interest>)
* [Risk Models](<https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHD-research-code/tree/main/05 Risk models>)

Additional R code can be found in the [UCL CORU site](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/) for:
* [Linkage of records using patient identifiers](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/LAUNCHESQI_Linkage)
* [Identification of pathways of care for CHD sentinel diagnosis groups](https://github.com/UCL-CORU/CHAMPION-work-stream-2)
