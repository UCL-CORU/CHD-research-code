02 Patient trajectories: R files 

R files allow to cobine the folling data sets into a patient data set (R file 02.01), where patients have multiple episodes, named "spells of care" (R file 02.02):

* National Congenital Heart Disease Audit (NCHDA)
* Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)
* Paediatric Intensive Care Network (PICANet)

Data was linked at record level outside CORU. 
CORU only received anonymised records with a study record ID that allowed to identify linked records.
